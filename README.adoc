Based on https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-examples/tree/master/asciidoc-to-revealjs-example
Bumped the reveal.js version, added PlantUML support

PlantUML needs the 'dot' command. Make sure you install Graphviz on your system!

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to reveal.js by invoking the 'asciidoctor' goal:

 $ ./gradlew clean asciidoctor

== IntelliJ

If you're using IntelliJ you can generate the IDE's files via:

 $ ./gradlew idea

Open the file _build/asciidoc/reveal/example-manual.html_ in your browser to see the generated revealjs file.

Or just Open... the build.gradle file.
